# Synopsis
  This repository contains the work I did for the final project for the Coursera course ["Statistical Inference"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/home/welcome).  
  
  This project is in two parts (leading to two pdf reports, as per assignment):  
  
  - a simulation exercise and
  - a basic inferential data analysis.
